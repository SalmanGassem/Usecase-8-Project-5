## Introduction
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to university rankings. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and patterns within the data that can help us better understand the factors that contribute to a university's ranking.

## Dataset Overview and Source
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Coursera, a popular online learning platform that offers courses from universities and companies worldwide. The dataset includes various features such as the course name, provider, ratings, number of reviews, duration, and other relevant attributes. This data was extracted through web scraping techniques from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=data&language=English&sortBy=BEST_MATCH) to compile a comprehensive overview of the available courses, enabling further analysis and insights into the patterns and factors contributing to course popularity and performance on the platform.
